#Inteligent Miner Helmet

This repo includes two projects: a MDK-ARM project that builds a program runnnin on a home-made STM32 F0 board and a node.js project that establishes a server and gathers the information from the STM32 F0, which is installed on the helmet.

In addition, the PCB board designed in Altium Designer will also be uploaded.

This repo is mostly a personal archive of code, but if you get any problem or interest, feel free to ask or discuss with me.
